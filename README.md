# UN_FAO_Food_Security
Selected data obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The goal of this project is to create two interactive choropleth maps showing global prevalence of undernourishment  and the global number of people undernourished over time.

Because the interactive choropleth maps do not render within GitHub (and until I figure out a workaround for that), the pdf file in the repository shows what the maps look like.
